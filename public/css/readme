About SCSS:

If you SASS then good, but if not keep these things in mind.

1.  Please don't change the CSS file directly because once 
    SCSS file get saved it overwrites the CSS file corresponding
    to its filename.
2.  If you have to make changes, add you styles seperately in the 
    SCSS file or create a new file and assign a self-explanotary name.

Basic 101:

1.  Any color declaration should not be done explicitly in CSS files.
2.  Use var(colorname) to assign any color to the DOM element.
3.  Never do position absolute/fixed if it is the last option.
4.  Never use margins to position your elements inside a container.
5.  Avoid using different fonts and use the variable names.
6.  Use em size unit because it relative to its parent element.

* Happy Coding *
